# Layers
## *What should I wear today?*

## Concept 
App & Website which looks at the weather and suggests what level of kit you will be needing


### Ideas

- Default levels of kit
  - adjust by your preferences
  - adjust by your avaliable kit
- Adjust by type of ride
  - Gravel - Slower
  - Wooded - Rain less important
    - need to pack a spare jacket
- Do you need mudguards?
- Ice Risk?
- User Feedback
  - Can "review" a previous suggestion to improve future ones
    - Too Hot/Cold/Wet/ Too much spare kit
